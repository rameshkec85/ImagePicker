# How to use ?


1. Capture the image through Camera:

     startActivityForResult(new Intent(this, ImageCaptureActivity.class), 100);

2. Similar to Gallery, picking the image from the gallery

     startActivityForResult(new Intent(this, GalleryActivity.class), 102);

3. File browser/picker:

startActivityForResult(new Intent(this, FilePickerActivity.class), 101);

Note: The above 3 methods will return the path with in intent using below key:

public static final String IMAGE_PATH = "image_path";


Need Improvements:

1. Provide the options in navigation drawer

2. File browser for images only

3. Publish to bintray
